# Param dual_big_box is true if we have set up the wing with two big battery
# boxes instead of some other configuration (one big battery + MVLV, one big
# battery + one small battery box, etc.). It tells the state machine whether
# to check the cell stack voltage of the other battery box before connecting
# to the LV bus, to prevent overcurrent from one box into another (since both
# big LV battery boxes use direct charging rather than DCDC trickle charger).
