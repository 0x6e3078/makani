This code is used to automate runs of external aerodynamics analyses using
Siemens STAR-CCM+ simulation software. Only the source code files are provided.

There are two types of analysis contained in this repository:
  - Wind tunnel type analysis
  - Multi rotor analysis

Conceptually, the code reads a file called "aero_input.cfd" to read what kind
of analysis to run and various customized settings. Not all options are
compatible. Pre-through-post can generally be set up in a most analysis types.
It is recommended that initial users of this tool attempt to first use it in
steps of pre, mesh, and then a coupled solve/post to assist in setup debugging.

This README file is by no means comprehensive of what is possible using this
tool and intends only to instruct in its basic usage to help get started at
best. Users are encouraged to understand the code structure and develop their
own approaches to run any analysis.

======================
Wind tunnel analyses:
======================
  A wind tunnel analysis is meant here for airfoil type anaylses.
  Wind tunnels can be run in 2D and 3D.

  A sample 2D, one domain, two element configuration file is located in
    "aero_input.cfd.airfoil"

  Conceptually, the code can have n-wind tunnel domains inside a single
  simulation. This approach has pros and cons. The pro is that a single sim
  file can contain different flap deflection angles and will improve its
  parallel solve efficiency. The cons are that with a large number of wind
  tunnel domains (>5), the preprocessing setup becomes extremelly slow and
  the post processing of a single simulation file can become very cumbersome
  if done manually.

  A single wind tunnel domain is a Composite Part named WT<Name>, e.g.:
    WTDomain
  which requires a Tag named WT<Name>, e.g. "WTDomain". 
    This Tag must be applied to every CAD body contained within WTDomain,
    including the Composite Part.
    This Tag must be applied to every Coordinate system associated with the
    wind tunnel domain.

  A single wind tunnel domain Composite Part must have the following objects:
    A wind tunnel domain CAD part:
      Part name: <FS Name>
      Surface names:
        000 <Inlet>
        001 <Outlet>
        004 <Symmetries>

    A set of wind tunnel coordinate systems:
      A Cartesian coordinate system named: WTDomain
        The X-axis is pointed at upstream alpha = 0.
        The Y-axis is oriented body down.
      A Cartesian coordinate system named: Body Csys
        The airfoil's total forces and moments are taken about the origin.
      A Cartesian coordinate system named: CAD Body Csys

    An Overset CAD body containing the airfoil or multi-element airfoil of
    interest (in this example there are 3 elements):
      Part name: OS1_OVERSET
      Surface names:
        006 <Overset>
        004 <Symmetries>
        0100 <Element 1>
        0100 <Element 1> TE
        0200 <Element 2>
        0200 <Element 2> TE
        0300 <Element 3>
        0300 <Element 3> TE

      There must be a nested Cartesian coordinate system named "OS1_OVERSET"
      with the z-axis its axis of rotation. The x-axis must be aligned with
      the zero alpha x-axis of the Body Csys coordinate system mentioned above.

      There must also be an equivalent Cartesian coordinate system for each
      element of the airfoil. The origin is where the forces and moment for
      each element is taken. The name of the coordinate system must match the
      name of the airfoil element exactly. For example, in the Surface names
      list above, there would be 3 coordinate systems required:
        Element 1
        Element 2
        Element 3

    Any boundary layer probe CAD part:
        Boundary layer probe CAD parts are typically used in 2D analyses and
        are comprised of CAD sheets that pierce the Z=0 plane and the surface
        of the airfoil at one position. The name of the CAD part must be:
          BLP_<Name>
          (e.g.: BLP_XC_0p25)

        A boundary layer probe part requires a nested coordinate system under
        the WTDomain coordinate system where the Z-direction is surface normal.
        It must be named with the exact same name as the CAD part, i.e.:
          BLP_<Name>

    Any volume control CAD parts:
        VC_<Name>_<PercentageOfBaseSize>
        (e.g.: VC_Wake_50.0)

================
Rotor analyses:
================
  A rotor analysis may have up to n-rotors within it. A single rotor requires a
  CAD body, an interface body, and a corresponding coordinate system.

  Rotors are meshed for a constant value of an equivalent wind tunnel alpha and
  are not swept in a single simulation solution.

  A sample dual rotor configuration file is located in
    "aero_input.cfd.dual_rtr"

  A rotor's behavior (reported position, axis of rotation, rotation rate,
  number of blades, and blade radius) is controlled and defined via its
  original CAD coordinate system. A rotor rotates about the Z-coordinate of
  its corresponding coordinate system.

  Modifing the rotor rotation rates in the configuration file will allow the
  user to change the rotor rotation speed in between analyses. This is useful
  when trying to start from an already initialized flow field.

  To set up a rotor analysis, these steps can be used as a guide:
    0) Have a freestream domain CAD body:
      Part name: <FS Name>
      Surface names:
        000 <Inlet>
        001 <Outlet>
        004 <Symmetries>

    1) Have a CAD body ready to use as a rotor.
      The blades should be broken out into their own surface.
      The blade trailing edges should be in their own surface.
      Part name: <CAD Body Name>
      Surface names:
        8000 <Blade name>
        8000 <Blade name> TE

    2) Have a cylinder CAD body that encapsulates the rotor.
      Part name: INT_<Blade name>
      Surface name: 009 Sliding

    3) Create a Coordinate System named:
      <CAD Body Name>_n<number_of_blades>_b<blade_radius>_w<rad/s>
      Note: 
        Rotors can be spun in the opposite direction by using a negative
        rad/s value
